# hello-world

Hi humans

My name is Mowgli. I grew up in the Jungles of India with a wolf pack with Raksha and Akela as my parents. I have a brother named Grey, hes the runt of the pack. I fought off Shere Khan the evil tiger to defend my pack and myself from his evil tiger jaws. Bagheera the Panther, and Baloo the Southpaw Bear are my companions. 

I also killed Kaa the python and King Louie the Orangatang.
